## About Me

<b>Undegraduate Degree</b>: BS Biochemistry at University of Missouri

<b>Graduate Program</b>: MS CS at DePaul University

<b>Graduation Date</b>: TBD 2023

<b>Specialization</b>: I have not formally decided on a specialization for my MS degree but I'm most interested in system-level programming and Artificial Intelligence.

## About My Advisor

<b>Name</b>: [Dr. Micha&eumll Cadilhac](https://michael.cadilhac.name/)

<b>University / Department</b>: DePaul University, Computer Science Department

<b>Area of Research</b>: Computer Science Theory applied to language, automata, and complexity.

## About My Project

<b>Description</b>: Analysis of Data throughput on a Field Programmable Gate Array [FPGA](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/sp701.html) with special interest in searching data input streams for key patterns via automata / finite state machines.

FPGA's have great potential to speed up data throughput relative to a standard processor.  Standard processors execute instructions sequentially while FPGA's execute operations in paralel.  Depending on the algorithm, it is possible to see orders of magnitude higher data throughputs in FPGAs.

As time passes, data is becoming more unstructured and FPGA's are playing larger roles in the analysis of this unstructured data.  Examples of unstructured data are:

<ul>
  <li>XML</li>
  <li>images</li>
  <li>videos</li>
  <li>emails</li>
</ul>

The key question I'd like to answer is, what types of automata / finite state machines can be implemented on an FPGA and how fast can these algorithms process data on an FPGA?
