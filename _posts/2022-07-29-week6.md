I've implemented an initial draft prgram to create a parse tree from a given regular expression.  It isn't fully complete as I still want to add functionality for sets ([abc]) among other things.

[Create parse tree from regex](https://github.com/bmeridet/regex_pt)

I also have a high-level idea of how to convert the parse tree into a circuit that can be implemented on an FPGA.  I need to figure out the specific data structures to use to help built the HDL from the parse tree.
