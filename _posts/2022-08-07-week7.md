Added functionality for sets ([abc]) in the creation of a parse tree from a regular expression represented as a string.

[Code to create parse tree and skeleton code for nfa](https://github.com/bmeridet/regex_pt)

Following a methodolgy similar to this [paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.158.3912&rep=rep1&type=pdf), I've begun the process of creating a nfa from a parse tree.

Contrary to my previous blog update, I believe the best method to create the nfa from the parse tree is going to be to utilize a post-order traversal of the tree, and 
construct as operators (*, +, ?, |, etc) are encountered.  Operator precedence should be taken into account during this process.

Once the nfa step is complete, the nfa can be used as a model to create a circuit using a hardware description language.
