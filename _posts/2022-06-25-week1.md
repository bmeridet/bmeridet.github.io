Looking into latency on circuits implemented on a FPGA.  Found a helpful paper on different adder implementations and their differing runtimes.

[Design and Delay Analysis of 256 bit Adders, Rachana S et al.](https://www.ijert.org/research/design-and-delay-analysis-of-various-256-bit-adders-using-verilog-IJERTCONV8IS11062.pdf)

Also, I was able to construct my own ripple carry adder, and run timing experiments for 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit circuits.  I found that as the bits processed increased, the latency of the circuit increased as well.
