Currently still looking into ethernet streaming into an FPGA.  I've found proprietary IP solutions from the FPGA vendor that may
work but need to look more into the interface and how to use the IP.  It may also be possible to write my own code for an ethernet
connection but it is pretty complex.

For the timebeing, I've followed some examples to implement a simple UART connection and the tester runs seem to be working

I'm also still studying the functional programming language ocaml along with a library hard caml (hardware design).  I found the resource
below that goes over Glushkovâ€™s algorithm, which contructs an NFA from a regular expression using sets.

[Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory](https://www.irif.fr/~jep/PDF/MPRI/MPRI.pdf)

Once an NFA is constructed, I can utilize that data in hard caml to create a state machine
