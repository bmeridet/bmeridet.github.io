Moving to the topic of representing regular expressions as NFA's and then converting NFA's into circuits using a HDL.  Below I've represented 4 of the basic components of regular expressions using systemverilog.

<b>Literal with flip-flop for state and comparator</b>

<b>Concatenation (ab)</b>

<b>Or (a|b)</b>

<b>Kleene, route signal forward and send it back as well</b>

Below is the circuit to represent the regular expression <b>(ab)*cc</b>

The next step is to figure out how to put these pieces together in an automated fashion based on a regular expression as input.  So far the most promising option is to use a higher level language to generate HDL or a filetype called a netlist.

I will also look into open source API's for moving code from higher level languages to HDL or a format readily usable by a FPGA
