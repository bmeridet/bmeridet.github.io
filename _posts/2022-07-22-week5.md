Found a new paper with an improved methodology for modeling regex nfa's as circuits, from the same group as the previous paper linked in week 3

[Compact Architecture for High-Throughput
Regular Expression Matching on FPGA, Prasanna et al](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.158.3912&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

The structure used in the above paper is much more modular and efficient.  BRAM (block RAM) is used to convert character lookup to a bit signal.  That signal is then sent to the state rergisters in the circuit.

<b>Representation of Literal - contains a state register, an or gate, and an and gate.  Connections are determined by nonterminals</b>

<b>BRAM - output is sent to the states in the circuit</b>

<b>Short example circuit for regex ab</b>

Moving forward, I beleive this is the best methodology to implement a regex-nfa as a circuit on an FPGA.  The next step is to automate the generation of circuits.  I'm currently looking into creating a parse tree that can be used to generate the HDL for the circuit implementation.
